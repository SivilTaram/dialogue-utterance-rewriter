            Note that this attention decoder passes each decoder input through a linear layer 
            with the previous step's context vector to get a modified version of the input. 
            If initial_state_attention is False, on the first decoder step the "previous context vector" is just a zero vector. 
            If initial_state_attention is True, we use initial_state to (re)calculate the previous step's context vector. We set this to False for train/eval mode (because we call attention_decoder once for all decoder steps) and True for decode mode (because we call attention_decoder once for each decoder step).
        pointer_gen: boolean. If True, calculate the generation probability p_gen for each decoder step.
        use_coverage: boolean. If True, use coverage mechanism.
        prev_coverage:
            If not None, a tensor with shape (batch_size, attn_length). The previous step's coverage vector. This is only not None in decode mode when using coverage.

    Returns:
        outputs: A list of the same length as decoder_inputs of 2D Tensors of
            shape [batch_size x cell.output_size]. The output vectors.

        attn_dists: A list containing tensors of shape (batch_size,attn_length).
